 <h2><strong>Module Content</strong></h2>
 <h2>HTML</h2>
 <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides the structure of content on the web by using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. Think of HTML as the backbone of any webpage, defining what content is present and how it is organized.

 </p>

 <h3>Lessons</h3>
 <ul>
    <li><strong>Text Sementics</strong></li>
    <br>
     <p>Text semantics in HTML refers to using elements that convey the <strong>meaning and purpose</strong> of content, rather than just its visual presentation. Instead of relying solely on generic elements like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and styling them with CSS, semantic HTML utilizes tags such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>. This approach offers several crucial benefits:</p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Semantic elements provide a clear structure that screen readers and other assistive technologies can interpret, enabling users with disabilities to navigate and understand content more effectively. For example, an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag explicitly tells a screen reader that its content is a top-level heading.</li>
                <li><strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO):</strong> Search engines prioritize well-structured content that uses semantic elements correctly. This helps them better understand the context and hierarchy of information on a page, leading to improved search rankings.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintainability and Readability:</strong> Semantic HTML creates a more logically structured document that is easier for developers to read, understand, and maintain. It clearly indicates the role of each content block, reducing confusion and simplifying future updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Future Compatibility:</strong> By adhering to semantic principles, your HTML code is more likely to remain compatible with evolving web technologies and standards.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>In essence, semantic HTML is about giving meaning to your web content, making it more robust, accessible, and understandable for both humans and machines.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Strctural</strong></li>
    <p>HTML uses various structural elements to organize content on a webpage. Elements like <Strong>&lt;div&gt;</Strong> and <Strong>&lt;span&gt;</Strong> are general-purpose containers, with &lt;div&gt; for block-level grouping and &lt;span&gt; for inline text. More semantic tags, such as <Strong>&lt;header&gt;</Strong> for introductory content, <Strong>&lt;nav&gt;</Strong> for navigation links, <Strong>&lt;main&gt;</Strong> for the dominant content, <Strong>&lt;section&gt;</Strong> for thematic groupings, <Strong>&lt;article&gt;</Strong> for independent content, and <Strong>&lt;footer&gt;</Strong> for copyright or authorship information, help define the purpose and structure of different parts of a web page.

    <br>
    <li><strong>Media</strong></li>
    <p>HTML allows you to easily embed various types of media into your web pages. The <Strong>&lt;img&gt;</Strong> tag is used for displaying images, while the <Strong>&lt;video&gt;</Strong> tag lets you include videos directly. For audio content, the <Strong>&lt;audio&gt;</Strong> tag is used. These elements support attributes for controlling playback, displaying controls, and linking to the media source, making your web content more dynamic and engaging.

<br>
    <br>
    <li><strong>List</strong></li>
    <p>HTML provides powerful ways to organize information into lists. The <Strong>&lt;ul&gt;</Strong> tag creates an **unordered list**, typically displayed with bullet points. For items that need a specific sequence, the <Strong>&lt;ol&gt;</Strong> tag forms an **ordered list**, usually numbered. Both list types use <Strong>&lt;li&gt;</Strong> tags to define individual **list items**, making content easy to read and structured.

    <br>

    <li><strong>Icons</strong></li>
    <p>Icons enhance user interfaces by providing visual cues. While HTML doesn't have a direct "icon" tag, they are commonly added using external libraries like Font Awesome or Google Material Icons, which utilize CSS and specialized font files to display scalable vector icons. Alternatively, small images (like SVG or PNG) can be embedded using the <Strong>&lt;img&gt;</Strong> tag to serve as icons.

    <br>
    <li><strong>HyperLinks</strong></li>
    <p>Hyperlinks, created using the <Strong>&lt;a&gt;</Strong> (anchor) tag, are fundamental to navigating the web. They allow users to click on text or images to jump to other web pages, specific sections within the same page, or even external websites. The <Strong>href</Strong> attribute specifies the destination URL, enabling seamless connections across online content.

<br>
<br>
<li><strong>Elements</strong></li>
<p>
    In HTML, an **element** is a fundamental component that structures and gives meaning to web content. Most elements consist of an **opening tag** (e.g., <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>), the **content** itself (like text, images, or other elements), and a **closing tag** (e.g., <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>). For instance, the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element defines a main heading, while <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> designates a paragraph.
</p>
<p>
    However, some elements are **self-closing** or **void elements**, meaning they do not contain content and thus don't require a separate closing tag. Examples include <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> for images and <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> for line breaks.
</p>
<p>
    Elements can also have **attributes**, which are special properties added to the opening tag to provide additional information or modify the element's behavior (e.g., <code>&lt;a href="url"&gt;</code> where <code>href</code> is an attribute). Understanding elements is key to building well-structured, semantic, and accessible web pages.

<br>
<br>
<li><strong>Tables</strong></li>
<p>
    HTML **tables** are used to display data in a structured, tabular format, organized into rows and columns. They are not intended for page layout, but strictly for presenting relational data cleanly.
</p>
<p>
    The core of an HTML table is the <Strong>&lt;table&gt;</Strong> element. Within it, <Strong>&lt;tr&gt;</Strong> (table row) defines a new row. Each row then contains either <Strong>&lt;th&gt;</Strong> (table header) cells for column titles, or <Strong>&lt;td&gt;</Strong> (table data) cells for the actual data.
</p>
<p>
    For better semantic structure and accessibility, tables can be further divided into distinct sections:
    <ul>
        <li>The <Strong>&lt;thead&gt;</Strong> element groups the header content of the table, typically containing one or more <Strong>&lt;tr&gt;</Strong> with <Strong>&lt;th&gt;</Strong> elements.</li>
        <li>The <Strong>&lt;tbody&gt;</Strong> element encloses the main data rows of the table, containing <Strong>&lt;tr&gt;</Strong> with <Strong>&lt;td&gt;</Strong> elements.</li>
        <li>The <Strong>&lt;tfoot&gt;</Strong> element is used for the footer content of the table, often for summaries or totals.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Tables can also include a <Strong>&lt;caption&gt;</Strong> element, which provides a descriptive title for the table, enhancing its accessibility and understanding. Attributes like <Strong>colspan</Strong> and <Strong>rowspan</Strong> allow cells to span across multiple columns or rows, enabling more complex table layouts for sophisticated data presentation.

 </ul>

 <h2><strong>CSS</strong></h2>
 <p>
    **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is the language used to **style** the look and feel of HTML documents. While HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, CSS controls its presentation â€“ things like colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and responsive design.
</p>
<p>
    CSS works by defining **rules** that select HTML elements and then apply specific **declarations** (properties and their values) to them. For example, a CSS rule might state that all paragraphs (`<p>` elements) should have blue text.
</p>
<p>
    There are three primary methods to apply CSS styling to an HTML page:
    <ul>
        <li>**Inline CSS:** Styles are added directly within an HTML element's `style` attribute.</li>
        <li>**Internal CSS:** Styles are defined in a tag located within the `<head>` section of the HTML document.</li>
        <li>**External CSS:** Styles are written in a separate  file and linked to the HTML page using a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section. This is the most recommended approach for larger projects.</li>
    </ul>

          <li><strong>CSS Text</strong></li>
          <p>This HTML document provides a practical overview of common CSS properties used to style text.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong><code>font-size</code></strong>: Controls the size of the text (e.g., <code>30px</code>).</li>
        <li><strong><code>font-weight</code></strong>: Sets the thickness or boldness of the text. Values can range from <code>100</code> (thinnest) to <code>900</code> (boldest), with common values like <code>normal</code> (usually <code>400</code>) and <code>bold</code> (usually <code>700</code>).</li>
        <li><strong><code>font-style</code></strong>: Specifies the font style, such as <code>normal</code>, <code>italic</code>, or <code>oblique</code>. <code>inherit</code> means it takes the style from its parent element.</li>
        <li><strong><code>text-decoration</code></strong>: Adds decorative lines to text. Common values include <code>underline</code>, <code>overline</code>, <code>line-through</code>, or <code>none</code>. You can also specify the style of the line (e.g., <code>dotted</code>).</li>
        <li><strong><code>text-transform</code></strong>: Controls the capitalization of text. Useful values are <code>uppercase</code>, <code>lowercase</code>, and <code>capitalize</code> (first letter of each word).</li>
        <li><strong><code>font-family</code></strong>: Defines the typeface used for the text. You can list multiple font names as fallbacks (e.g., <code>Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif</code>). This example also shows how to import custom fonts from Google Fonts.</li>
        <li><strong><code>color</code></strong>: Sets the color of the text. Colors can be defined by name (e.g., <code>chartreuse</code>), RGB values (e.g., <code>rgb(200, 100, 100)</code>), or hexadecimal codes (e.g., <code>#23181a</code>).</li>
        <li><strong><code>line-height</code></strong>: Adjusts the spacing between lines of text within a paragraph.</li>
        <li><strong><code>letter-spacing</code></strong>: Controls the space between individual characters.</li>
        <li><strong><code>word-spacing</code></strong>: Adjusts the space between words.</li>
        <li><strong><code>text-align</code></strong>: Aligns the text horizontally within its container (e.g., <code>center</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>justify</code>).</li>
        <li><strong><code>text-shadow</code></strong>: Adds a shadow effect to text. Values typically include horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur radius, and color (e.g., <code>2px 10px 10px rebeccapurple</code>).</li>
    </ul>
       <strong>Key Takeaways</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inline Styles</strong>: All the examples use **inline styles** (<code>style="..."</code>), which are applied directly to HTML elements. While convenient for quick demonstrations, for larger projects, it's generally better practice to use **external CSS stylesheets** for better organization and maintainability.</li>
        <li><strong><code>head</code> section</strong>: The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section contains important metadata like character set (<code>charset</code>), viewport settings, and the page title. It's also where external resources like custom fonts (from Google Fonts in this case) are linked.</li>

    <li><strong>Background Styling</strong></li>

    <p>This document summarizes key CSS properties for styling backgrounds, based on the provided code example.</p>

<strong>CSS Background</strong>

    <ul>
        <li><strong><code>background-color</code></strong>: Sets the solid color of an element's background. (Commented out in the example, but a common property.)</li>
        <li><strong><code>background-image</code></strong>: Specifies an image to use as the background. (Commented out in the example.)</li>
        <li><strong><code>background-repeat</code></strong>: Controls how a background image repeats.
            <ul>
                <li><code>no-repeat</code>: The image is displayed only once.</li>
                <li>Other values include <code>repeat</code> (default, repeats horizontally and vertically), <code>repeat-x</code> (repeats horizontally), and <code>repeat-y</code> (repeats vertically).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>background-attachment</code></strong>: Determines whether the background image scrolls with the content or stays fixed.
            <ul>
                <li><code>fixed</code>: The background image remains in a fixed position relative to the viewport, even when the rest of the page scrolls.</li>
                <li><code>scroll</code>: (Default) The background image scrolls along with the content of the element.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Shorthand `background` property</strong>: A concise way to set multiple background properties in one declaration.
            <ul>
                <li><code>background: linear-gradient(to top, lightblue, yellow);</code>: This example uses a **linear gradient** as the background, transitioning from `lightblue` at the bottom to `yellow` at the top. This single `background` property can also include `background-image`, `background-repeat`, `background-attachment`, `background-position`, and `background-size`.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS background properties offer powerful ways to visually enhance elements.</li>
        <li>You can use solid colors, images, or even gradients as backgrounds.</li>
        <li>Properties like <code>background-repeat</code> and <code>background-attachment</code> provide fine-grained control over how backgrounds behave.</li>
        <li>The `background` **shorthand property** is very useful for combining multiple background-related declarations into a single, more readable line of code.</li>

    <li><strong>CSS Borders</strong></li>
    <p>This document provides a simple note on CSS border properties, based on the provided HTML code example.</p>

    <h3>Key CSS Border Properties</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong><code>border</code> shorthand property</strong>: This is a convenient way to set the <code>border-width</code>, <code>border-style</code>, and <code>border-color</code> all in one declaration.
            <ul>
                <li>Example: <code>border: 1px solid red;</code> creates a 1-pixel wide, solid red border.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>border-style</code></strong>: Defines the style of the border (e.g., <code>solid</code>, <code>dotted</code>, <code>dashed</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>groove</code>, <code>ridge</code>, <code>inset</code>, <code>outset</code>, <code>none</code>, <code>hidden</code>). You can also set individual sides (e.g., <code>border-bottom-style: solid;</code>).</li>
        <li><strong><code>border-width</code></strong>: Sets the thickness of the border (e.g., <code>1px</code>, <code>2em</code>, <code>thin</code>, <code>medium</code>, <code>thick</code>).</li>
        <li><strong><code>border-color</code></strong>: Specifies the color of the border (e.g., <code>red</code>, <code>rgb(255, 3, 3)</code>, <code>#FF0000</code>).</li>
        <li><strong><code>border-radius</code></strong>: Used to create rounded corners for an element.
            <ul>
                <li>Example: <code>border-radius: 12px;</code> applies a uniform 12-pixel radius to all corners.</li>
                <li>Setting <code>border-radius: 50%;</code> on a square element (like the `div` in the example) creates a perfect circle.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>box-shadow</code></strong>: Adds a shadow effect around an element's frame.
            <ul>
                <li>Example: <code>box-shadow: 5px 7px 9px red;</code> creates a shadow with a 5px horizontal offset, 7px vertical offset, 9px blur radius, and a red color.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>padding</code></strong>: Creates space between the element's content and its border.
            <ul>
                <li>Example: <code>padding: 8px;</code> adds 8 pixels of padding on all sides.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Borders are fundamental for defining the visual boundaries of elements.</li>
        <li>The `border` shorthand property is highly efficient for quickly applying common border styles.</li>
        <li>`border-radius` is essential for modern designs, allowing for soft, rounded corners or even circular shapes.</li>
        <li>`box-shadow` and `padding` are often used in conjunction with borders to enhance an element's appearance and spacing.</li>

    <li><strong>CSS Box Model</strong></li>

    <p>The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design that describes how HTML elements are rendered on a page. Every HTML element can be considered a rectangular box, and this model defines how the dimensions and spacing of these boxes are calculated.</p>

    <p>Understanding the Box Model is crucial for controlling the layout and spacing of elements on your webpage.</p>

    <h3>Components of the Box Model</h3>

    <p>The Box Model consists of four main components, from the inside out:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>This is the innermost part of the box, where the actual content (text, images, videos, etc.) of the element resides. Its dimensions are determined by the `width` and `height` properties.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Padding</h3>
            <p>Padding is the transparent space immediately surrounding the content. It creates "breathing room" between the content and the element's border. Padding adds to the total size of the element.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>CSS properties: <code>padding-top</code>, <code>padding-right</code>, <code>padding-bottom</code>, <code>padding-left</code>, or the shorthand <code>padding</code>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Border</h3>
            <p>The border is a line that goes around the padding and content. It's the visible edge of the element's box.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>CSS properties: <code>border-width</code>, <code>border-style</code>, <code>border-color</code>, or the shorthand <code>border</code>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Margin</h3>
            <p>Margin is the transparent space outside the border. It creates space between the element and other surrounding elements. Margins also add to the total space an element occupies on the page.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>CSS properties: <code>margin-top</code>, <code>margin-right</code>, <code>margin-bottom</code>, <code>margin-left</code>, or the shorthand <code>margin</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Margin Collapse:</strong> Vertical margins between adjacent block-level elements can collapse, meaning the larger of the two margins is used, not their sum.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Visual Representation of the Box Model</h3>
    <pre>

|  +-----------------------------+  |
|                                   |
+-----------------------------------+
    </pre>

    <h3>`box-sizing` Property</h3>

    <p>By default, the `width` and `height` CSS properties apply only to the **content** area of the element.</p>
    <p>However, the `box-sizing` property allows you to change this behavior:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><code>box-sizing: content-box;</code> (Default)</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>`width` and `height` only refer to the content area.</li>
                <li>Padding and border are added *on top* of the specified `width` and `height`, increasing the total size of the element.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong><code>box-sizing: border-box;</code></strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>`width` and `height` include the content, padding, AND border.</li>
                <li>Padding and border are *included within* the specified `width` and `height`. This makes it much easier to size elements accurately without complex calculations, especially in responsive layouts.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's a common practice to set `box-sizing: border-box;` globally for all elements using the following CSS:</p>
    <pre><code>
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Importance</h3>
    <p>A solid grasp of the CSS Box Model is essential for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Predicting and controlling element sizes.</li>
        <li>Precisely managing spacing between elements.</li>
        <li>Troubleshooting layout issues.</li>
        <li>Creating effective and responsive web designs.</li>

<li><strong>CSS Floating</strong></li>
 <p>The provided HTML code demonstrates a common use case for the **CSS `float` property**: wrapping text around an image. Let's break down what's happening:</p>

    <h3>Understanding the Code</h3>

    <p>In your `&lt;style&gt;` section, you have the following CSS for the `&lt;img&gt;` tag:</p>
    <pre><code>
img {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    float: left;
    margin-right: 12px;
}

    <ul>
        <li><strong>`width: 200px;` and `height: 200px;`</strong>: These properties set the fixed dimensions of your image to 200 pixels by 200 pixels.</li>
        <li><strong>`float: left;`</strong>: This is the core property here. It tells the browser to:
            <ul>
                <li>Take the `&lt;img&gt;` element out of the normal document flow.</li>
                <li>Position it to the **left** side of its containing element (in this case, the `&lt;body&gt;`).</li>
                <li>Allow subsequent **inline content** (like the text within your `&lt;p&gt;` tag) to flow around its right side.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>`margin-right: 12px;`</strong>: This adds 12 pixels of transparent space to the right of the image. This creates a visual gap between the floated image and the text that wraps around it, preventing the text from directly touching the image.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The `&lt;br&gt;` Tag</h3>
    <p>You've also included a `&lt;br&gt;` (line break) tag right after the `&lt;img&gt;` tag. While `float` causes text to wrap, a `&lt;br&gt;` forces a line break in the normal flow. In this specific scenario, because the image is floated, the `&lt;br&gt;` might not have a visible effect on the text wrapping, as the paragraph content would naturally wrap around the float anyway. However, it's generally not needed when using `float` for text wrapping.</p>
    
    <h3>How it Affects the Layout</h3>

    <p>When you open this HTML document in a browser, you'll observe the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The "CSS Floating" heading (`&lt;h1&gt;`) appears at the top.</li>
        <li>The image (`&lt;img&gt;`) is positioned to the left.</li>
        <li>The long paragraph of "Lorem ipsum" text (`&lt;p&gt;`) flows around the right side of the image. It starts next to the image and continues below it once it runs out of vertical space beside the image.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Key Takeaways from this Example</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The `float` property is effective for **text wrapping around images** or other small elements.</li>
        <li>Use `margin` on the floated element to create **space** between it and the surrounding content.</li>
        <li>Remember that `float` takes elements out of the normal document flow, which can sometimes lead to **parent container collapse** if not addressed with clearing techniques (though not explicitly shown in your simplified code, it's an important consideration for more complex layouts).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While `float` is useful for this specific visual effect, for more complex page layouts (like multi-column structures), modern CSS methods like **Flexbox** or **CSS Grid** are generally recommended for their greater control and flexibility.</p>

       <li><strong>CSS Margins</strong></li>

    <p>This HTML note explains the CSS `margin` property based on the provided code example. Margins are a fundamental part of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#box-model" target="_blank">CSS Box Model</a>, creating space <strong>outside</strong> the border of an element, pushing other elements away from it.</p>

    ---

    <h3>Understanding the `margin` Property</h3>

    <p>In your provided code, the `body` element has CSS applied to its margin:</p>
    <pre><code>
body {
    /* margin ekkin karanne element dekak atara space ekak hadanawa e element ekata outside eken  */
    /* margin: 0; */
    /* margin-top: 20; */
    /* margin-right: 30; */
    /* margin-bottom: 17; */
    /* margin-left: 36;   */

    margin: 12px 24px 36px 48px;

    /* margin: 12px 24px; */
}
    </code></pre>

    <h3>1. What Margins Do:</h3>
    <p>As indicated in your commented-out Sinhala note, `margin ekkin karanne element dekak atara space ekak hadanawa e element ekata outside eken` (What a margin does is create space between two elements, outside that element). This perfectly summarizes its function: margins define the transparent space around an element, separating it from adjacent elements.</p>

    <h3>2. Individual Margin Properties:</h3>
    <p>You've commented out the individual margin properties, which allow precise control over each side:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>margin-top</code>: Sets the margin on the top side.</li>
        <li><code>margin-right</code>: Sets the margin on the right side.</li>
        <li><code>margin-bottom</code>: Sets the margin on the bottom side.</li>
        <li><code>margin-left</code>: Sets the margin on the left side.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Values can be in pixels (`px`), percentages (`%`), ems (`em`), rems (`rem`), or `auto` (often used for horizontal centering block elements).</p>

    <h3>3. `margin` Shorthand Property:</h3>
    <p>The `margin` property is a shorthand that allows you to set all four margin sides in a single declaration. The order of values matters:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Four values: `margin: top right bottom left;`</strong>
            <pre><code>margin: 12px 24px 36px 48px;</code></pre>
            <p>This sets a 12px top margin, 24px right margin, 36px bottom margin, and 48px left margin on the `body` element. This is the active margin rule in your provided code.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Two values: `margin: vertical_sides horizontal_sides;`</strong>
            <pre><code>/* margin: 12px 24px; */</code></pre>
            <p>This (commented out) example would set 12px for both top and bottom margins, and 24px for both left and right margins.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>One value: `margin: all_sides;`</strong>
            <pre><code>/* margin: 0; */</code></pre>
            <p>This (commented out) example would set 0px for all four margins.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>External Spacing:</strong> Margins create space *outside* an element's border. Contrast this with `padding`, which creates space *inside* the border, between the border and the content.</li>
        <li><strong>Controlling Layout:</strong> Margins are crucial for controlling the spacing between different HTML elements on a page.</li>
        <li><strong>Shorthand Efficiency:</strong> The `margin` shorthand property is very efficient for setting all sides at once.</li>
        <li><strong>Margin Collapse:</strong> Be aware of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing" target="_blank">margin collapse</a>, where vertical margins between adjacent block-level elements can combine, resulting in the larger of the two margins, rather than their sum. This doesn't happen with horizontal margins.</li>
        <li><strong>`body` Margin:</strong> Browsers often apply default margins to the `body` element. Setting `margin: 0;` (or similar) on the `body` is a common practice to remove these default margins and gain full control over the page layout.</li>
    </ul>

<br>
<li><strong>CSS Padding</strong></li>
  
    <p>This HTML note explains the CSS **`padding` property** based on your provided code. Padding is a crucial part of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model" target="_blank">CSS Box Model</a>, creating space **inside** an element, between its content and its border.</p>

    ---

    <h3>Understanding the `padding` Property</h3>

    <p>In your provided CSS, you've applied padding to both the `body` and `div` elements:</p>
    <pre><code>
body {
    padding: 30; /* Note: Missing 'px' unit - see explanation below */
}

div {
    /* ... other styles ... */
    /* padding ekak kiyanne ee adala element eke content ekayi ee element ekee border ekayi atara space eka tamay padding kiyanne (inside of the element) */
    /* No padding property actually applied here */
}
    </code></pre>

    <h3>1. What Padding Does:</h3>
    <p>As your commented-out Sinhala note accurately describes, `padding ekak kiyanne ee adala element eke content ekayi ee element ekee border ekayi atara space eka tamay padding kiyanne (inside of the element)`. This means padding creates an inner buffer zone, pushing the element's content away from its border.</p>

    <h3>2. Applying Padding:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>`body { padding: 30; }`</strong>: You've applied a `padding` value of `30` to the `body`.
            <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> In CSS, you almost always need to specify a **unit** when setting lengths (e.g., `px` for pixels, `em`, `rem`, `%`, etc.). While some browsers might try to interpret `30` as `30px`, it's best practice and required for consistent behavior to explicitly write `padding: 30px;`.</p>
            <p>This would apply a 30-pixel padding to all four sides (top, right, bottom, left) of the `body` element.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>`div` Element</strong>: Although you have a comment explaining padding within the `div`'s style block, there is no actual `padding` property applied to the `div` in your provided code. If you were to add, for example, `padding: 20px;` to the `div` styles, the text "Lorem ipsum..." inside the div would have a 20-pixel space between itself and the black border of the `div`.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Padding Shorthand:</h3>
    <p>Similar to `margin`, `padding` also has a powerful shorthand property:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>`padding: value;`</strong>: Applies the value to all four sides (top, right, bottom, left). (e.g., `padding: 15px;`)</li>
        <li><strong>`padding: vertical_value horizontal_value;`</strong>: Applies the first value to top/bottom, and the second to left/right. (e.g., `padding: 10px 20px;`)</li>
        <li><strong>`padding: top_value right_value bottom_value left_value;`</strong>: Allows individual control for each side, in a clockwise order starting from the top. (e.g., `padding: 5px 10px 15px 20px;`)</li>
    </ul>

    ---

    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>**Internal Spacing:** Padding creates space *inside* an element, between its content and its border. This makes the content more readable and provides visual breathing room.</li>
        <li>**Box Model Component:** Padding is one of the four key components of the CSS Box Model (Content, Padding, Border, Margin).</li>
        <li>**Units Are Important:** Always specify units (like `px`, `%`, `em`) when defining CSS lengths to ensure proper rendering across browsers.</li>
        <li>**Affects Element Size:** By default (`box-sizing: content-box;`), adding padding increases the overall width and height of an element. If you want the padding to be *included* within a defined `width` and `height`, use `box-sizing: border-box;`.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Understanding padding helps you control the internal layout and appearance of your HTML elements.</p>

            </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>ID Selector</h3>
            <p>Selects a single unique HTML element with a specific `id` attribute. IDs **must be unique** within an HTML document.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Syntax: Starts with a hash symbol (<code>#</code>) followed by the ID name.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>
#main-header {
    text-align: center; /* Selects the element with id="main-header" */

            </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Class Selector</h3>
            <p>Selects all HTML elements that have a specific `class` attribute. Classes can be applied to **multiple** elements.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Syntax: Starts with a dot (<code>.</code>) followed by the class name.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>

            </code></pre>
            <p>HTML Example:</p>
            <pre><code>
&lt;p class="highlight"&gt;Important information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;button class="button"&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;
            </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Universal Selector</h3>
            <p>Selects all HTML elements on the page. Useful for applying global styles (though use with caution for performance).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Syntax: An asterisk (<code>*</code>).</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>
* {
    box-sizing: border-box; /* Applies to all elements */
    margin: 0;             /* Resets default margins on all elements */
}
            </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Attribute Selector</h3>
            <p>Selects HTML elements based on the presence or value of their attributes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Syntax: Uses square brackets `[]`.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>
a[target="_blank"] {
    color: green; /* Selects all &lt;a&gt; elements with target="_blank" */
}

input[type="text"] {
    border: 1px solid gray; /* Selects all &lt;input&gt; elements with type="text" */
}
            </code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Combinator Selectors</h2>

    <p>Combinators explain the relationship between the selectors.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Descendant Selector (Space)</h3>
            <p>Selects all elements that are descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of a specified element.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Syntax: `ancestor_selector descendant_selector` (separated by a space).</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>
div p {
    line-height: 1.5; /* Selects all &lt;p&gt; elements inside a &lt;div&gt; */
}
            </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Child Selector (`>`)</h3>
            <p>Selects elements that are direct children of a specified element.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Syntax: `parent_selector > child_selector`.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>
ul > li {
    list-style-type: square; /* Selects all &lt;li&gt; elements that are direct children of a &lt;ul&gt; */
}
            </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Adjacent Sibling Selector (`+`)</h3>
            <p>Selects an element that is immediately preceded by a specified element, and both share the same parent.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Syntax: `element_one + element_two`.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>
h2 + p {
    margin-top: 0; /* Selects a &lt;p&gt; element that immediately follows an &lt;h2&gt; */
}
            </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>General Sibling Selector (`~`)</h3>
            <p>Selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element (share the same parent) and come after it in the HTML.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Syntax: `element_one ~ element_two`.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>
h2 ~ p {
    text-indent: 20px; /* Selects all &lt;p&gt; elements that are siblings of an &lt;h2&gt; and come after it */
}
            </code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements</h2>

    <p>These allow you to select elements based on their state or a specific part of an element.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Pseudo-classes (`:`)</h3>
            <p>Selects elements based on a special state (e.g., when a user hovers over them, or when a link has been visited).</p>
            <pre><code>
a:hover {
    color: orange; /* Selects &lt;a&gt; elements when the mouse pointer is over them */
}

input:focus {
    border-color: blue; /* Selects &lt;input&gt; elements when they are focused */
}

li:nth-child(even) {
    background-color: #f2f2f2; /* Selects every even &lt;li&gt; element */
}
            </code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Pseudo-elements (`::`)</h3>
            <p>Selects and styles a specific part of an element (e.g., the first line of text, or inserts content before/after an element).</p>
            <pre><code>
p::first-line {
    font-weight: bold; /* Styles the first line of &lt;p&gt; elements */
}

div::before {
    content: "Start of section: "; /* Inserts text before the content of &lt;div&gt; */
}
            </code></pre>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Selector Specificity</h2>

    <p>When multiple CSS rules target the same element, **specificity** determines which rule's styles are applied. A more specific selector will override a less specific one.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inline styles</strong> (e.g., `style="..."`) have the highest specificity.</li>
        <li><strong>IDs</strong> (`#id`) are highly specific.</li>
        <li><strong>Classes</strong> (`.class`), <strong>attributes</strong> (`[attr]`), and <strong>pseudo-classes</strong> (`:hover`) have medium specificity.</li>
        <li><strong>Elements</strong> (`p`), and <strong>pseudo-elements</strong> (`::before`) have low specificity.</li>
        <li>The <code>!important</code> declaration overrides all other specificity, but should be used sparingly as it makes CSS difficult to maintain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS selectors are essential for applying styles precisely to your HTML elements.</li>
        <li>Mastering different selector types and combinators gives you fine-grained control over your design.</li>
        <li>Understanding **specificity** is crucial for debugging and predicting which styles will be applied when conflicts arise.</li>
        <li>Using descriptive class names and keeping IDs unique helps in writing maintainable and readable CSS.</li>

    <h2> Module Contents </h2>
    <h1>HTML</h1>

    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the essential backbone of every webpage, defining its structure. It uses "tags" to organize content like headings, paragraphs, images, and links, telling your browser how to display them. Crucially, HTML is not a programming language; it simply marks up and describes content, forming the static foundation for webpages.</p>
    
    <h3> Lessons </h3>
    <ul> 


    <li><strong>Text Sementics</strong></li>
     <p><blockquote>Text semantics in HTML refers to using elements that convey the <strong>meaning and purpose</strong> of content, 
        rather than just its visual presentation. Instead of relying solely on generic elements like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and 
        <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and styling them with CSS, semantic HTML utilizes tags such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, 
        <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, 
        <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>. This approach offers several crucial benefits:</blockquote></p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <blockquote>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Semantic elements provide a clear structure that screen readers and other assistive technologies can interpret, enabling users with disabilities to navigate and understand content more effectively.

                <li><strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO):</strong> Search engines prioritize well-structured content that uses semantic elements correctly. This helps them better understand the context and hierarchy of information on a page, leading to improved search rankings.</li>

        <li><strong>List</strong></li>
         <p><blockquote>This HTML code demonstrates the three main types of lists used on webpages, 
            each serving a distinct purpose for organizing information. First, the Unordered List <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> displays
            items with bullet points, perfect for lists where the order doesn't matter (like a shopping list). 
            Second, the Ordered List <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> presents items with numbered or lettered sequences, ideal when the order is important 
            (like steps in a recipe). Finally, the Definition List <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> is used for terms and their corresponding descriptions. 
            Here, <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> defines the "term" and <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> provides its "description", making it great for glossaries or FAQs. Together, 
            these list types provide flexible ways to structure and present content clearly and logically in HTML.</blockquote></p>

        <li><strong>HyperLink</strong></li>
        <p><blockquote>This HTML code demonstrates the fundamental concept of hyperlinks, created using the anchor element <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, 
            which are essential for navigation on the web. It showcases several ways to link to different destinations: 
            connecting to external web pages (like Google or Facebook), linking to internal web pages within the same project using both relative 
            paths (e.g., ./../exercises/exercises-2.html) and absolute paths (e.g., /exercises/exercises-1.html). Additionally, 
            it illustrates how to open links in a new browser tab (target="_blank") and how to create a "mailto" link to easily compose an email. 
            These variations highlight the versatility of the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag in connecting users to content both within and outside a website.</blockquote></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Images <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> Shows how to display pictures using both local files (from your project folder) and external URLs. The src attribute points to the image location, style controls its size, and alt provides descriptive text for accessibility.</li>
            <li>Videos <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> Explains how to embed video files, again using both local and external sources. The src attribute links to the video, style sets dimensions, and the controls attribute adds built-in play, pause, and volume controls.</li>
            <li>Audios <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> Illustrates embedding audio files. Similar to video, src specifies the audio file, and controls provides standard playback options.</li>
            <li>Iframes <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> Shows how to embed content from another website directly into your page. The src attribute contains the URL of the content to embed, and width and height control the size of the embedded frame. This is useful for displaying external maps, videos (like from YouTube), or entire web pages within your own.</li>

        <li><strong>Icons</strong></li>
        <p><blockquote>This HTML code demonstrates how to easily incorporate icons into a webpage using an external library called Font Awesome. 
            Instead of using image files, Font Awesome provides icons as special fonts. The key part is the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section, 
            which connects your HTML file to Font Awesome's stylesheet (hosted online via a CDN). Once linked, you can display various icons by 
            using the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> (italic) tag with specific class names (like fa-solid fa-house). This method is efficient because icons are scalable 
            like text and can be easily styled with CSS, making them a popular choice for navigation menus, social media links, and other visual cues on websites.</blockquote></p>

            It showcases various input types like text fields, numbers, passwords, dates, radio buttons (for single choices), and checkboxes (for multiple choices). 
            You'll also see how to add labels (to describe input fields), text areas (for longer messages), buttons (to submit data or trigger actions), and dropdown lists (for predefined options). 
            All these elements are grouped within the main <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag, making it easy to build dynamic parts of a website where users can enter and send their data.</blockquote></p>

        <li><strong>Tables</strong></li>
        <p><blockquote>This HTML code demonstrates how to create tables for organizing data in rows and columns on a webpage.
           It starts with a simple table structure, showing how to use <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> as the container, <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> for the header row, <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> for the body content, 
           <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> for each table row, <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> for table headers (bold and centered by default), and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> for table data (regular cells). The included CSS ensures the table has visible borders.
           <br />
           The code then illustrates two advanced features:</blockquote></p>
           <blockquote>
           <ul>
            <li>colspan: This attribute merges cells horizontally, allowing a single cell to span across multiple columns.</li>
            <li>rowspan: This attribute merges cells vertically, letting a single cell extend down through multiple rows.</li>

        <li><strong>Strctural</strong></li>
         <p><blockquote>This HTML code provides a hands-on demonstration of structuring a webpage using various semantic and non-semantic HTML5 elements. 
        It starts with the versatile <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>  for general content grouping and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> for inline styling. The code then introduces semantic tags like <nav> for
        navigation links, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> for introductory content (often including navigation), and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>footer for copyright and contact information. Further down, 
        it demonstrates <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> to group related content, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> for independent, self-contained content (like a blog post), <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> for supplementary 
        content (like sidebars or related links), and <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> to define the dominant content of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. Together, these elements are crucial for building 
        well-organized, accessible, and meaningful web layouts.</blockquote></p>

  <h1>CSS</h1>
  <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language used to control how HTML content looks on a webpage. While HTML provides the structure (like the skeleton of a house), CSS is like the interior designer and painter. 
    It tells browsers about colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and overall visual presentation. With CSS, you can make text red, change font sizes, position elements on the page, add backgrounds, and even create animations. 
    It keeps your style rules separate from your HTML structure, making your code cleaner, easier to manage, and allowing you to change the look of an entire website from a single file.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Inline CSS:* This is when you put style rules directly inside an HTML tag using the style attribute e.g., <code>&lt;style="color: blue;"&gt;</code>. It's quick for one-off changes but not great for larger projects.</li>
        <li>Internal CSS:* Styles are defined in a tag located within the section of the HTML document. </li>
        <li>External CSS:* This is the best method for most projects. You write all your CSS in a separate .css file and link it to your HTML document using a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. This keeps your styles organized and lets you apply the same styles to many pages easily.</li>

It demonstrates properties for controlling font size, weight (boldness), and style (italic). You also learn to add text decorations (underline), transform text case (uppercase, lowercase), 
            and choose font families. The code covers setting text colors using various formats and adjusting line height, letter spacing, and word spacing for readability. Finally, it shows how to control text alignment and add text shadows. Essentially, this example illustrates how CSS is used to fully customize the visual appearance of all text on your webpage.</p>

        <li><strong>CSS Specificity</strong></li>
        <blockquote><p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language that makes your web content look good. It controls colors, fonts, layout, and more. When different CSS rules try to style the same part of your webpage, CSS Specificity acts like a tie-breaker, determining which style "wins." Rules with higher specificity override those with lower specificity. <br>The specificity hierarchy, from lowest to highest, is generally:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Element Selectors: (e.g., p, div) - Styles directly applied to HTML element names.</li>
            <li>Class Selectors: (e.g., .content) - Styles applied to elements with a specific class attribute.</li>
            <li>ID Selectors: (e.g., #main-content) - Styles applied to elements with a unique id attribute.</li>
            <li>Inline Styles: (e.g., style="background-color: purple;") - Styles written directly within the HTML tag itself. These are the most specific.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In your example, the single <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element has multiple conflicting background color rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>p selector: background-color: green; (Lowest specificity)</li>
            <li>.content selector: background-color: red;</li>
            <li>#main-content selector: background-color: blue;</li>
            <li>div p selector: background-color: yellow; (More specific than p alone)</li>
            <li>div .content selector: background-color: orange; (More specific than .content alone)</li>
            <li>div #main-content selector: background-color: aqua; (More specific than #main-content alone)</li>
            <li>#card #main-content selector: background-color: coral; (More specific than div #main-content because #card adds another ID to the chain)</li>
            <li>Inline Style: style="background-color: purple;" (Highest specificity)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because the inline style background-color: purple; is directly on the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, it has the highest specificity. Therefore, the paragraph will ultimately have a purple background. This demonstrates that inline styles always take precedence over all other CSS selector types for that specific property. Understanding specificity is key to troubleshooting why certain styles aren't applying as expected in your web projects.</p>

        <li><strong>CSS Selectors</strong></li>
        <blockquote><p>This HTML code, with its many commented CSS rules, demonstrates the various CSS Selectors used to target and style specific elements on a webpage. CSS itself is the language that controls how web content looks. The different selectors include element names (p), classes (.heading), IDs (#title), attributes (a[target="_blank"]), and relationships between elements like descendants (div p), children (div > p), and siblings (h2 + p, h1 ~ p). It also shows pseudo-classes (:hover, :first-child) for styling elements based on their state, and pseudo-elements (::first-letter, ::before) for styling parts of an element. Finally, grouping selectors (h1, h2) allow applying styles to multiple elements at once. Mastering these selectors is fundamental for precisely controlling your website's design.</p>

The div element is given a border to make the spacing visible. The code shows how to set margins for all four sides at once (e.g., margin: 12px;), individually (e.g., margin-top: 20px;), or using shorthand notations for top/bottom and left/right, or top/right/bottom/left. Essentially, margins are key for controlling the external spacing between elements, helping you arrange them neatly on your webpage.</p>

        <li><strong>CSS Paddinng</strong></li>
        <blockquote><p>This HTML code, along with its CSS, demonstrates the fundamental concept of padding in CSS, which is used to create space inside an element's border, pushing content away from the edges. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language that styles your web content, defining its appearance and layout.
        In this example, a div element is given a specific width, height, and border to make it visible. The padding: 12px; rule applies an equal padding of 12 pixels to all four sides (top, right, bottom, left) inside the div. This creates space between the div's border and the paragraph content (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>Lorem ipsum...) within it.
        Think of padding as the "personal space" an element's content needs from its own boundary, while margins (as discussed before) create space between elements. Understanding padding is crucial for controlling the internal spacing and visual comfort of your content within its containers on a webpage</p>

        <li><strong>CSS Floating</strong></li>
        <blockquote><p>This HTML code, along with its CSS, demonstrates the float property, a classic CSS technique used to position elements, most commonly for wrapping text around an image. The <img> tag is styled with float: left; which pulls it to the left side of its container, allowing the subsequent paragraph text to flow and wrap neatly around its right side. An additional margin-right on the image ensures there's some space between the image and the surrounding text. While float was historically used for broader layouts, its main contemporary application is for this specific text-wrapping effect.</p>

It shows how to set a solid background color (background-color), create gradient backgrounds (background: linear-gradient), and use background images (background-image). Properties like background-repeat control if an image repeats, background-attachment determines if it scrolls or stays fixed, and background-size: cover; ensures the image fills the entire background area. Ultimately, this code teaches you how to visually enhance your webpages with diverse and dynamic backgrounds.</p>

The example shows a paragraph (<p>) and a div element, both styled with borders. You can control a border's style (e.g., solid), width (e.g., 5px), and color (e.g., blue) individually or using a convenient shorthand property like border: 3px solid blue;. Additionally, the code illustrates box-shadow to add a shadow effect behind the element and border-radius to create rounded corners, allowing you to soften the element's appearance. Essentially, these CSS properties give you precise control over the visual boundaries and subtle depth of your webpage elements.</p>

        <li><strong>CSS Box Model</strong></li>
        <blockquote><p>This HTML code, combined with its CSS, vividly illustrates the CSS Box Model, a fundamental concept explaining how every HTML element is treated as a rectangular box on a webpage. This box comprises four layers, from innermost to outermost: the content itself (your text), padding (space inside the border, pushing content away from the edges), the border (the visible line around the element), and margin (space outside the border, pushing the element away from other elements). Understanding this model, as shown with the div's defined padding, border, and margin, is crucial for precisely controlling the size, spacing, and positioning of all elements in your web layouts.</p>

    <li><strong>CSS Important</strong></li>

    <p>However, when !important is added to a CSS property declaration (e.g., color: red !important;), it gives that specific rule the highest possible priority, overriding all other conflicting styles for that property, including inline styles.This HTML code, along with its CSS, demonstrates the !important rule in CSS, which is used to override even the highest specificity rules when styling an element.

ID Selector (#main-title): color: blue;
Inline Style: style="color: orange"
Even though inline styles usually have the highest specificity, both the h1 and .title rules have !important. When multiple !important rules conflict, specificity (ID > Class > Element) still applies among them. In this case, since both h1 and .title target the element, the .title (class selector) has higher specificity than h1 (element selector) among the !important rules. Therefore, the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element's text will ultimately be green.
While !important is powerful for forcing styles, it's generally recommended to use it sparingly as it can make CSS harder to manage and debug due to its overriding nature.

    <p>This HTML code, along with its CSS, demonstrates CSS Flexbox, a powerful and efficient layout model for arranging items in a single row or column. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the visual presentation and layout of web elements.
The key to Flexbox is the display: flex; property applied to a container (in this case, div.container). This turns the container into a flex container and its direct children (.box elements) into flex items. Flexbox then provides properties to control how these items are laid out:</p>
<ul>
    <li>flex-direction: Defines the main axis, setting the direction in which flex items are placed (e.g., row for horizontal, column for vertical, or their reverse versions).</li>
    <li>justify-content: Aligns items along the main axis (e.g., flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly).</li>
    <li>align-items: Aligns items along the cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis) within a single line (e.g., flex-start, flex-end, center, stretch).</li>
    <li>flex-wrap: Controls whether flex items should wrap onto multiple lines if they exceed the container's size (e.g., wrap allows wrapping, nowrap keeps them on one line).</li>
    <li>align-content: Aligns multiple lines of wrapped flex items along the cross axis when there's extra space (only visible when flex-wrap is active).</li>
    <li>gap (or row-gap, column-gap): Creates space between flex items, simplifying spacing compared to using margins.</li>
</ul><p>By using Flexbox, you can easily create responsive and dynamic layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and content, making it a cornerstone of modern web design.</p>

        <li>transition-property: Specifies which CSS property to animate (e.g., background-color, transform).</li>
        <li>transition-duration: Sets how long the transition should take.</li>
        <li>transition-timing-function: Defines the speed curve of the transition (e.g., ease, linear, ease-in-out).</li>
        <li>transition-delay: Adds a delay before the transition begins.</li>
        <li>Shorthand Property: These can be combined into one line like transition: background-color 1s ease-in-out 2s;.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In your examples, a button's background color smoothly changes on hover, a circle animates its color, size, and position, an image scales and rotates on hover, and a heading's opacity fades in. This shows how transitions can be applied to almost any CSS property to create engaging and dynamic user interfaces.</p>

    <li><strong>CSS Grid</strong></li>
    <blockquote><p>This HTML code, with its CSS, demonstrates CSS Grid, a modern layout system for creating two-dimensional page designs with rows and columns. The key is to set display: grid; on the container. You then use grid-template-columns to define the size and number of columns and gap to add space between the grid items. Grid is ideal for building complex, responsive layouts, making it a powerful tool for modern web development.</p>

    <li><strong>CSS animations</strong></li>
    <blockquote><p>This HTML code demonstrates CSS Animations, a powerful feature for creating smooth, multi-step visual effects. CSS is what controls how a webpage looks. The process has two main parts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Defining the Animation: Using the @keyframes rule, you define what the animation does at different stages (e.g., 0%, 50%, 100%).</li>
        <li>Applying the Animation: You link the animation to an element with the animation property. This property sets the animation's name, duration, how many times it runs (iteration-count), and other timing details.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Essentially, this code shows you how to bring elements to life by defining a sequence of style changes and then applying that sequence to an element on your webpage.</p>

<li><strong>Media Queries</strong></li>
<blockquote><p>This HTML code, with its CSS, demonstrates Media Queries, a key feature for creating responsive web designs. Media queries let you apply different styles to a webpage based on the screen's characteristics, such as its width. In this example, the heading and paragraph have a default style. However, if the screen is under 399px wide (like a phone), the heading and paragraph styles change. A separate rule changes the heading's style again if the screen is between 500px and 800px wide (like a tablet). This method ensures your website looks good and functions well on any device.</p>
